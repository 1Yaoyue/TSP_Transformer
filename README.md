# TSP_Transformer

ortool.ipynb是ortool求解器对于TSP问题的求解

Transformer.ipynb是神经网络的训练，训练后的模型存储在checkpoint中

debugging Image是过程中一写记录的照片

visualization_Transformer_ortool.ipynb是对比Transformer训练与ortool训练的结果


“ortool.ipynb" is the implementation of solving the TSP problem using the OR-Tools solver.

"Transformer.ipynb" involves training a neural network, with the trained model being stored in checkpoints.

"debugging Image" consists of photos documenting certain observations or issues during the process.

"visualization_Transformer_ortool.ipynb" compares the results of training the Transformer with those obtained from OR-Tools.
